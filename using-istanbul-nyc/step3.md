# Reviewing the Pinger Tests

Now let's review the unit tests that will be executed.

**Test 1:** Go to the `test` directory to take a look at the tests.

`cd /root/pinger/app/test`{{execute}}

You'll see there is only one test file in force, `http-tests.js`.

**Test 1:** Examine the tests in the file, `http-tests.js`.

`cat http-tests.js`{{execute}}

Notice there are 6 tests.
