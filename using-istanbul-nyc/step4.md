# Running the Pinger Tests and Analyzing Results

In this step well execute the unit tests and also run code coverage. The project, `pinger` ships with a
second HTTP server that publishes the test report generated by `Instanbul/Nyc`.

**Task 1:** Navigate back to the application source code directory so that we can run the tests.

`cd /root/pinger/app/`{{execute}}

Take a look at `package.json`.

`cat package.json`{{execute}}

Notice in the `scripts` section there is a `test` command as
well as an entry for a `coverage` command.

```json

 "scripts": {
    "test": "nyc mocha",
    "start": "node server.js",
    "coverage": "nyc --reporter=lcov --reporter=text-lcov npm test && node testdocserver.js"
  }
```

The `test` command will execute the unit test and out put a coverage report summary.

The `coverage` command runs code coverage and generates the coverage report. Also, the command stars the test documentation
server that ships with `pinger`. (**NOTE**: The test documentation server is custom programmed for `pinger`.)

**Task 2:** Execute the following command to run the`pinger` unit tests.

`npm test`{{execute}}

The unit tests will report pass and fail. Also generate a code coverage summary.

```

**Task 3:** Execute the following command to generate a coverage report in HTML.

`npm run coverage`{{execute}}

**Task 4:** To view the HTML files in a browser go here:

https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3001-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

**Task 5:** To shut down the Test Documentation Server, [curl](https://www.lifewire.com/curl-definition-2184508)
the following URL:

`curl https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3001-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/stop`{{execute}}


The home page for the coverage report should look something like the following
that looks like the following.
