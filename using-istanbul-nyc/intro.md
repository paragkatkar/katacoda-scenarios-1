## Educational Objective
The objective of this scenario is to demonstrate how to apply Mocha testing and [Istanbul/Nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc)
code coverage to an application running under [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).


## What You Need To Know Before You Start
In order to get full benefit from the concepts and tasks presented in this scenario you need to have basic understanding
of how to enter commands in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. Each step has commands that can be entered
into the interactive terminal automatically by clicking on the command.

There is no need to type directly into the terminal window. Clicking on a command will automatically execute it.

Also, it's useful to understand the basics of programming Node.js using Javascript as well as the basic of running
unit tests in the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework.
