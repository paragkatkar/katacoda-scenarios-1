# Reviewing the Pinger Code

Next we need to install the Node.js dependency packages that `pinger` needs to run and also needs to execute tests.

**Task 1:** Go to the directory that has the application source code.

`cd pinger/app/`{{execute}}

**Task 2:** Install the Node.js dependencies

`npm install`{{execute}}

**Task 3:** Take a look at the server code to get a sense of the application logic.

`cat server.js`{{execute}}

Let's start up the `pinger` API so see the information it provides. 

**Task 4:** Execute the following command to start the `pinger` API server.

`node server.js`{{execute T2}}
