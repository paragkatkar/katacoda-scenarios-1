As mentioned previously in Step 3, the assignment of a `Role` to a subject -- a user, group or even a services (process) -- is the purpose of
a `RoleBinding`.

The illustration above describes a RoleBinding in which a user, `reselbob` is assigned to the Role, `pds-viewer`.
Also, the group, `Developers` is assigned to the Role, `pds-viewer`.

The next step will show how how to create a Role and RoleBinding using a manifest.
