**Step 1:** Switch back to being the admin in the context `kubernetes`.

`kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes`{{execute}}

You'll get output as follows:

`Switched to context "kubernetes-admin@kubernetes"`

**Step 2:** Let's take a look at the manifest for the Role that we'll apply to the group, `devs`

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  namespace: devs
  name: simple-pod-developer
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create","get", "list"]
```

**FRIENDLY REMINDER:** We assigned the user `dicktracy` to the group `devs` when we created dicktracy's security certificates
back in Step 8, in this command:

`openssl req -new -key dicktracy.key -out dicktracy.csr -subj "/CN=${MAGIC_USER}/O=devs/O=tech-leads"`

In the  option, `-subj`, like so:

`-subj "/CN=${MAGIC_USER}/O=devs/O=tech-leads`

**WHERE**

* `/CN=${MAGIC_USER}` is the name of the user
* `/O=devs/` declares a group, `devs`
* `/O=devs/` declares a group, `tech-leads`

**Step 3:** Create the `simple-pod-developer` Role that allows creating and listing pods as we defined in the YAML file above.

`kubectl apply -f simple-dev-role.yaml`{{execute}}

You'll get output as follows:

`role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/simple-pod-developer created`

**Step 4:** Let's take a look at the manifest we'll use to create the RoleBinding that associates the group, `devs` with the Role,
`simple-pod-developer`.

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  namespace: devs
  name: simple-pod-developers
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    name: devs
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: simple-pod-developer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

**Step 4:** Create the RoleBinding, `simple-pod-developers` that allows the group, `devs` to assume the 
role, `simple-pod-developer`.

`kubectl apply -f simple-dev-rolebinding.yaml`{{execute}}

You'll get output as follows:

`rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/simple-pod-developers create`

**Step 5:** Now, switch back to be `dicktracy`

`kubectl config use-context ${MAGIC_USER}@kubernetes`{{execute}}

You'll get output as follows:

`Switched to context "dicktracy@kubernetes".`

Run this command: 

`kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 pinger-dk --image=reselbob/pinger:v2.3 -n devs`{{execute}}

You'll get output as follows:

`pod/pinger-dk created`

**Step 6:** Let's see if indeed `dicktracy` could make pods by virtual of the fact that the user is in the group `devs`.

`kubectl get pods -n devs`

You'll get output as follows:

```text
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pinger-dk   1/1     Running   0          2m13s
```

**But wait!** Something mysterious just happened. Didn't we create a pod named, `pinger-dk` in the previous step? How could this have 
happened? Let's answer the question by switching back to the use `kubernetes-admin`.

**Step 7:** Switch back to be `kubernetes-admin` by changing the context.

`kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes`{{execute}}

You'll get output as follows:

`Switched to context "kubernetes-admin@kubernetes".`

**Step 8:** Let's get the pods in all namespaces and filter by the pod name, `pinger-dk`

`kubectl get pods  --all-namespaces | grep pinger-dk`

You'll get output as follows:

```text
devs          pinger-dk                                 1/1     Running   0          12m
test          pinger-dk                                 1/1     Running   0          17m
```
The first column in the output shown above is the namespace. Notice that the namespace, `devs` has a pod named, `pinger-dk` and
the namespace `test` has a pod named, `pinger-dk`. This is perfectly OK. You can have pods with duplicate names as long as
each pod is in a distinct namespace.
