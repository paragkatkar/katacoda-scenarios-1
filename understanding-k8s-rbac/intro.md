## Educational Objective
The objective of this scenario is to describe the basics of Kubernetes Role Based Access Control ([RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)). Also
you'll learn how to use RBAC to create a user that has limited operational access only to particular Kubernetes API resources.


## What You Need To Know Before You Start
In order to get full benefit from the concepts and tasks presented in this scenario you need to have basic understanding
of how to enter commands in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. Each step has commands that can be entered
into the interactive terminal automatically by clicking on the command.

There is no need to type directly into the terminal window. Clicking on a command will automatically execute it.
