## You've crossed the finish line!

In this scenario you learned:

* How to install the Kubernetes Metrics Server so that we could get monitor behavior of pods running in a Kubernetes cluster
* How to create a single pod deployment of a web server application intended to be autoscaled by HPA
* Installed a test container from which to call the web server application from within the Kubernetes cluster
* How to apply HPA to monitor and scale up the number of pods as the first pod exceeded resource allocation
* How to monitor pods in order to observe HPA scale up more pods to meet usage demand,

We hope you found this scenario informative, engaging and fun. We are more scenarios of about different aspects of
Kubernetes in the works. We hope you return to make more of our offerings soon!
