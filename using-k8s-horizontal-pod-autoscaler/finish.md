## You've crossed the finish line!

In this scenario you learned how to:

* Install the Kubernetes Metrics Server so that we could monitor the behavior of pods running in a Kubernetes cluster
* Create a single pod deployment of a web server application intended to be autoscaled by HPA
* Install a test container from which to call the web server application from within the Kubernetes cluster
* Apply HPA to monitor and scale up the number of pods as the first pod exceeded resource allocation
* Monitor pods in order to observe HPA scale up more pods to meet usage demand,

We hope you found this scenario informative, engaging and fun. We have more scenarios in the works that cover
man different aspects of Kubernetes . We hope you return to make more of our offerings soon!
