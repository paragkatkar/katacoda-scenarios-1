**IMPORTANT**: You need to have done tasks described previously in Step 4 in order for all the concepts and instructions
in this step to make sense and work. If you have not done Step 4, please go back!

In this step we're going to take a look how Kubernetes uses the Horizonal Pod Autoscaler to accommodate increased
loads placed on the pods in a deployment.

**TODO:** `Figure how to open up a second terminal into the master`

Let's open a second terminal window and imperatively create an HPA on the nginx deployment using the `kubectrl autoscale`
command. The HPA will keep an eye on the pods that are backing the nginx service. We'll set the `--cpu-pecentage` option
on the `kubectrl autoscale` command to a threshold of 50%. Also, we'll tell the HPA to have a mininum of 1 pod running
(`--min=1`), but no more than 5 pods (`--max=5`).

`kubectl autoscale deployment nginx --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=5`{{execute}}

Let's see the status of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

`kubectl get hpa`{{execute}}

As you can see, the HPA is running and we're getting back useful information.

**In the next step we'll take a more in-depth view the behavior of the HPA.**
