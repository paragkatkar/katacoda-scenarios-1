# What is K8S Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Why is it important?

## Educational Objective

To teach the learner the nature and use of [Kubneretes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/), which is also known by the
 shorthard term, K8S HPA.

## What To Expect

After taking this scneario you will:

* Understand how to use the  Katakoda interactive learning environment to understand key concepts
and master hands on techniqures required to work with K8S HPA.
* Understand how K8S HPA ensures that your application or service always has the number of pods necessary
to operate as the best efficiency possible.
* Be able to create a simple autoscaling deployment using K8S HPA imperatively at command line.
* Be able to view the state of your deployment running under K8S HPA using standard `kubectl` commands.

## What You Need To Know Before You Start

In order to get full benefit from this scenario, we expect that you have some introductory familiarity
with Kubernetes. You need to have a working knowledge of [clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cluster-administration-overview/), [pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/),
[deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) and [services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). Also, you should be
comfortable working with the command, [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).

We'll show you exactly the commands you will be using, but having a conceptual understanding of the commands and
object we're working with will help you learn in a more meaningful way, beyond simple rote recital.
