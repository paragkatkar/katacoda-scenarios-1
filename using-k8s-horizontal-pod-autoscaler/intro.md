## Educational Objective

To teach the learner the nature and use of [Kubneretes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/), which is also known by the
 shorthard term, K8S HPA.
<a name="what-to-expect"></a>
## What To Expect

After taking this scneario you will:

* Understand how to use the  Katacoda interactive learning environment to understand key concepts
and master hands on techniqures required to work with K8S HPA.
* Understand how K8S HPA ensures that your application or service always has the number of pods necessary
to operate at the best efficiency possible.
* Be able to create a simple autoscaling deployment using K8S HPA imperatively at command line.
* Be able to view the state of your deployment running under K8S HPA using standard `kubectl` commands.
* Maximize that capacity of a pod and witness K8S HPA reduce load burden by adding more pods to your Kubernetes cluster

## What You Need To Know Before You Start

In order to get full benefit from this scenario, we expect that you have some introductory familiarity
with Kubernetes. You need to have a working knowledge of [clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cluster-administration-overview/), [pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/),
[deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) and [services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). Also, you should be
comfortable working with the command, [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).

We'll show you exactly the commands you will be using, but having a conceptual understanding of the commands and
objects you're working with will help you learn in a more meaningful way, well beyond simple rote entry of commands in terminal window.
