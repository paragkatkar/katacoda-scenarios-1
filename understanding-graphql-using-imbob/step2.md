**IMPORTANT**: You need to do the steps in sequence in order for the state of the lesson's learning environment to be
consistent. Otherwise, you'll get behaviors that might be confusing.

In this step we're going to configure the GraphQL Playground with
the authentication password that IMBOB requires for access to the API. 

**Task 1:** Go to the URL shown below to bring the GraphQL Playground up in your browser. Copy the URL in the address the browser's
address bar.

https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com

**Task 2:** Then, once in GraphQL Playground of IMBOB, add the following JSON

`{"authorization":"ch3ddarch33s3"}`{{copy}}

to the HTTP Headers section in the lower left of GraphQL Playground as shown the following figure:
 
![Authenticate to GraphQL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reselbob/katacoda-scenarios/master/understanding-graphql-using-imbob/images/graphql-authorization-01.png)
 
This will authenticate your session the IMBOB API. Now you can do some work.

**Let's move onto the next step** where you'll learn how to execute simple and complex queries against the IMBOB API
using the GraphQL Query Language in GraphQL Playground.
