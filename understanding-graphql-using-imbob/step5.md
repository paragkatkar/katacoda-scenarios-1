Go the your browser window that has the GraphQL Playground page we called in an earlier step.

Open another new tab in GraphQL Playground. We're going to execute a GraphQL mutation in this pane 
that will fire the event, `eventAdded` on the server side. This event will be published by the
subscription to which registered in the last step, Step 4.

Copy the following GraphQL `mutation` declaration into the new tab pane and then click the
execute arrow in the GraphQL Playground UI.

`
mutation{
  ping(payload: This is a simple payload message."){
    createdAt
    payload
    name
    id
  }
}
`{{copy}}
