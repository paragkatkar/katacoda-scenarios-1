**IMPORTANT**: You need to do the steps in sequence in order for the state of the lesson's learning environment to be
consistent. Otherwise, you'll get behaviors that might be confusing.

Open another new tab in GraphQL Playground.

Add the security access token by copy and pasting

{"authorization": "ch3ddarch33s3"}`{{copy}}

We're going to execute a GraphQL mutation in this pane 
that will fire the event, `eventAdded` on the server side. This event will be published by the
subscription to which registered in the last step, Step 4.

Copy the following GraphQL `mutation` declaration into the new tab pane and then click the
execute arrow in the GraphQL Playground UI.

`
mutation{
  ping(payload: This is a simple payload message."){
    createdAt
    payload
    name
    id
  }
}
`{{copy}}
