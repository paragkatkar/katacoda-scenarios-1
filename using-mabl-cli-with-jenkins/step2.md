In this step you're going to create an account in mabl. Of course, the assumption is that you do not have an account already. If you do have an account in mabl, you'll be asked to login and then continue on to the next step in this scenario by clicking the `Continue` button at the bottom of the pane.

**Step 1:**  Create an account on the mabl appliction login page:

https://app.mabl.com/login

If you have an account, login. If not, click on this link, [`No account? Sign Up ->`](https://app.mabl.com/signup) or the link on the `mabl` login page as shown in the figure below:

Complete with the `mabl` sign up process by filling in the required information to create an account.

Once you have an account, you'll be able to create tests using the `mabl` test trainer.

The following minute and a half video provides a brief overview of using the `mabl` test trainer. Feel free to view it before moving on.
