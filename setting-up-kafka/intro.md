## Educational Objective
The objective of this scenario is to show you how to install a [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) message broker in the Katacoda interactive
learning environment. Also, the scenario will walk you through the steps of setting a topic and then publishing a message
into that topic. Finally, you'll create a consumer to retrieve all the messages submitted to the topic.


## What You Need To Know Before You Start
In order to get full benefit from the concepts and tasks presented in this scenario you need to have basic understanding
of how to enter commands in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. Each step has commands that can be entered
into the interactive terminal automatically by clicking on the command.

There is no need to type directly into the terminal window. Clicking on a command will automatically execute it.


## Working with Kafka

Apache Kafka is a platform for persistent messaging at web scale. You use Kafka to create topics and publish messages
and message streams into the given topic. Then you create consumers against the given topic to receive messages.
