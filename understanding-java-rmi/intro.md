## Objective

The objective of this scenario is to demonstrate how to work with Java Remote Method Invocation ([RMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation)). Java RMI is a Java API that allows a client to call a method in an object that runs on a remote process or even on a separate machine on the network. The machine running the remote code is called the *RMI server*.

In this scenario you'll be provided with instructions to download the code from GitHub and then build both the RMI server and client. Also, you'll be shown how to invoke the RMI remote object registry. The remote object registry is the mechanism that make remote methods avaiable to the network or to other process on your local machine.

This scenario is completely interactive. The instructions you'll be given will be executed directly in terminal windows in the Katacoda interactive learning environment.
